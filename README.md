# Coucou

**A tiny friend that lives in your MacBook's notch — or at the top of your screen on Windows — and keeps an eye on your coding sessions. Claude Code on macOS; Claude Code and Codex on Windows.**

Approve permissions, watch your agents work, drop a file, chat with Claude or Codex — all without leaving what you're doing.

## Why

Some studios showed off gorgeous notch companions… and never let anyone use them.
**Coucou is the open version.** Every line of code, every animation, every sound — free to use, read, fork and remix.

Meet **Mochi**: a soft little squircle with big eyes that pops out of your notch, waves hello, follows your cursor with its eyes, gets annoyed when you poke it (and dizzy if you insist), and tells you the moment your coding agent needs you.

## Features

- 🤖 **Coding sessions, live** — see Claude Code sessions on macOS and Windows, plus Codex sessions on Windows: what each agent reads, edits and runs, step by step.
- ✅ **Approve from the notch** — Claude Code and Codex permission requests show up on Windows with **Allow / Deny**. One click, back to work.
- 🧑‍💻 **Jump to the right terminal** — open the exact terminal window of a session *(macOS)*.
- 💬 **Ask Claude or Codex** — built-in chat from the notch. Windows can use your signed-in Codex CLI; macOS keeps its Claude chat.
- 📎 **Drop a file on the notch** — Mochi turns into a box and swallows it, then ask a question about it or send it by email *(email: macOS, Mail.app)*.
- 🪟 **Drag Mochi onto any window** — attach that window as context for Claude *(macOS)*.
- 🔌 **Integrations** — Stripe payments, n8n workflows, GitHub, Vercel deployments, Resend emails, Notion, Cal.com. Each one gets its own little colored Mochi.
- 🎭 **A real character** — idle breathing, blinks, eyes on a sphere that follow your mouse, emotes, 28 handcrafted sounds, a greeting on launch.
- 🫥 **Invisible when idle** — hides away when nothing is running, peeks out when you hover the notch (the top edge of the screen on Windows).
- 🔒 **Private by design** — no telemetry, no account. Keys live in your macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager. The app only talks to the services you plug in.

## Install

### Download for macOS

1. Grab the latest `Coucou.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases).
2. Unzip and move **Coucou.app** to `/Applications`.
3. Launch. This build isn't notarized by Apple yet, so the first time macOS says it can't verify the developer: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** (only once).

### Download for Windows

1. Grab [`Coucou-Windows-setup.exe`](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases/download/windows-latest/Coucou-Windows-setup.exe) — always the newest Windows build.
2. Run it. The installer isn't code-signed yet, so SmartScreen warns about it: click **More info → Run anyway**. It installs for your user only and asks for no administrator rights.
3. Launch — Mochi appears at the top of your main screen.

There is no notch on a PC, so the island slides out of the top edge of the screen
instead of hiding inside one. See [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md) for the
rest of the differences.

### Build from source

**macOS** — requirements: macOS 15+, Xcode 16+, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou.git
cd coucou/NotchBuddy
xcodegen
open NotchBuddy.xcodeproj   # then ⌘R
```

**Windows** — requirements: [Rust](https://rustup.rs), Node 20+, MSVC build tools.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou.git
cd coucou/windows
npm install
npm run pack                # installer lands in windows/release/
```

## Setup

Click the Coucou icon in the menu bar (macOS) or in the system tray (Windows) → **Settings…**

| What | Why | Where the key goes |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code hooks** | live sessions and approvals | **Install hooks** — Coucou backs up `~/.claude/settings.json`, merges its hooks and shows you the diff before writing anything |
| **Codex hooks (Windows)** | live Codex sessions and approvals | **Install hooks** — Coucou previews and backs up the Codex hook config. After install, review and trust Coucou's hook in Codex CLI with `/hooks` |
| **Chat provider** | built-in chat | Claude uses an Anthropic API key. Codex uses the local Codex CLI sign-in; run `codex login` and choose ChatGPT sign-in to use your eligible ChatGPT plan. |
| Stripe, n8n, GitHub, Vercel, Resend, Notion, Cal.com | the integration pills | Keychain / Windows Credential Manager, all optional |

If Coucou isn't running, the hook exits immediately: **Claude Code and Codex keep their normal terminal approval flow.** Codex also requires you to trust Coucou's current hook definition in `/hooks`; a changed definition needs review again.

## Things to try

| Do this | Mochi does that |
|---|---|
| Hover the notch (top edge on Windows) | peeks out and says hi 👋 |
| Click it | opens |
| Hover Mochi | blinks, eyes grow |
| Click Mochi | squish + annoyed |
| Click 3 times fast | 😵‍💫 dizzy for a few seconds |
| Drag a file onto the island | turns into a box and swallows it |
| Drag Mochi onto a window *(macOS)* | attaches it as context |

## How it works

**macOS**

- **Island**: a borderless `NSPanel` hugging the notch, driven by a small state machine (`hidden → petit → home`).
- **Character**: drawn in SwiftUI `Canvas` + `TimelineView` at 60 fps — squircle body, eyes projected on a sphere, spring animations. No Rive, no Lottie, no images.
- **Claude Code**: a tiny `nb-hook` script receives hook events and forwards them over a Unix socket to the app. For approvals it waits for your click, then answers the hook.
- **Integrations**: lightweight pollers, paused when nothing is watching.
- **Sounds**: 28 short WAVs played through preloaded `AVAudioPlayer`s.

The macOS app is native Swift 6 / SwiftUI / AppKit with **zero third-party dependencies**.

**Windows**

- A [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) app (Rust + TypeScript): the island is a transparent, always-on-top window that never steals focus, Mochi is drawn in Canvas 2D with the same shapes, timings and sounds as on the Mac.
- Claude Code and Codex hooks go through a tiny `coucou-hook.exe` and a named pipe; keys live in Windows Credential Manager. Codex chat runs the local CLI with your saved ChatGPT sign-in.
- Details and differences in [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md).
